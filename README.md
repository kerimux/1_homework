## Inspiration 
Block Inc. (formerly Square Inc) was founded in February 26, 2009, by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey. 
In 2009, Jim McKelvey, a glassblower and artist, was unable to complete a $2000 sale for one of his art pieces because he couldn't accept credit card payments. This experience led to the idea of creating a simple and accessible way for small businesses to accept card payments. Jim McKelvey approached his friend Jack Dorsey with the idea. Jack Dorsey, who was already well-known as one of the co-founders of Twitter, became interested in the concept. Together, they co-founded Square, Inc. Square's initial product was a small, square-shaped device that could be plugged into the headphone of a smartphone or tablet, turning it into a card reader. This device allowed businesses and individuals to accept card payments on their mobile devices. Square has since grown into a major financial services and mobile payment company, offering a wide range of products and services beyond card readers, including point-of-sale software, business financing, and more.

## Funding
Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey, the co-founders, invested their own money to get the company off the ground. This personal investment provided the initial capital needed for product development and early operations. Square attracted venture capital funding to support its growth. These investors provided additional funding in exchange for equity in the company. Square went through several rounds of financing to raise capital for expansion and development. In 2009, Square raised 10 million dollars in Series A, in 2010 raised 27.5 million dollars in Series B. In 2012 Square announced partnership with Starbucks, which included 25 million dollars investment and an agreement to accept Square's payment system in Starbucks stores. This investment provided Square with exposure to a large customer base. In 2015, Square when public with it's IPO, raising $243 million by selling shares to the public. The company was valued at around $2.9 billion at the time of it's IPO
